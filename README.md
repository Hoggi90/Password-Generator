# Password-Generator

# Desciption

### This project involved me building a random passwod generator using javascript. I managed to use a combinations of if statements, while loops, different window prompts as well as functions to create this. 


# Usage

## You can access the page via this link: https://hoggi90.github.io/Password-Generator/

### Click on "Generate Password", follow the instructions of the prompt windows, choose the desired length, whether you want numbers, lowercase, uppercase letters or special characters in the password. The random password will then be generated.

### Right-click on the browser and choose inspect, then click on console to view the JS script.
